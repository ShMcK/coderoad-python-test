Levels without steps are meant to be used as only informative content, for example: use a Level without steps at the end of the tutorial to congratulate the student and provide some additional related resources.\n\nTutorial's content. It can span through multiple paragraphs and use headers `####` and `#####`.\n\nSteps are identified and their content described using the following regex:\n\n```js\n/^(###\\s(?<stepId>(?<levelId>L\\d+)S\\d+)\\s(?<stepTitle>.*)\\n+(?<stepContent>[^]*))/;\n```\n\nThe numbers identifying the levels and steps are irrelevant but keep in mind that they will be executed in order. A level with id `10` will be executed before another one with id `20` and so on. These `ids` should have a match in the configuration file (`coderoad.yaml`)."
